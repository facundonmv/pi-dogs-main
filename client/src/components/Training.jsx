                <p className="containerResp">It is necessary to adapt the education to the respective dog, since the conditions are different. Belonging to a breed is only one aspect, but there are also differences within the same breed, even within the same litter. Whether it is a purebred dog or a mix, some quadrupeds learn and forget quickly, others take longer and remember what they have learned. It is more difficult to teach furry ones who are quickly distracted in the presence of others of their kind. Dogs with a great hunting instinct also have different requirements regarding their education. And independent dogs are quick to understand what their humans want from them, but they also need a good reason to obey. Tip: Positive reinforcement and consistency are training methods that work well for any dog.</p>

                <p className="containerResp">In many cases it is an advantage to train only one dog. However, training with two quadrupeds is also sometimes useful. In general, during education in daily life both furry are present.</p>

                <h1 className="containerPreg">3-Risks when training with two dogs at the same time</h1>
                <p className="containerResp">If you practice with two dogs at the same time, you run the risk of them making the wrong connections. The proper timing of praise and snacks is crucial for success in education. With two dogs this is more complicated. Newbies to dog training can be easily confused. Each dog must have its own compliment to avoid confusion. Educating two furry ones during puberty can be very exhausting. Training is easier when one of the quadrupeds already knows the basics, as it can serve as a model for a younger or newer dog. Pay attention not to disturb the hierarchy of the dogs during joint training. This could lead to competition if the lower ranked dog is more obedient and receives many rewards in front of the higher ranking member of the pack. Here you need to be very tactful.</p>

                <h1 className="containerPreg">4-Tips to educate dogs of different breeds</h1>
                <p className="containerResp">The more similar the character and constitution of both dogs, the easier the joint education and training sessions will be. When furry ones are especially independent and do not like to subordinate themselves, you need to have more patience for training. If you want to train two dogs together you should try to train them both properly. It is not convenient to train a highly motivated papillon together with a stubborn spitz-type dog. In some situations it is possible to use an advanced canine as a role model.</p>

                <p className="containerResp">This short summary does not include all races, so it is not complete. For example, the various dogs of the original type or the Nordic hunting and sledding dogs are missing. Training dogs of different breeds is promising when they belong to groups with similar needs or even to the same group. Of course, character traits are tendencies that don't apply to all quadrupeds. Whether they are pedigree dogs or mongrels: you must know the personality of each dog well and adjust the education accordingly. Do not overload your furry ones and remember that for dogs that are not used to other dogs, the fact of sharing training is already an important lesson in their education.</p>
